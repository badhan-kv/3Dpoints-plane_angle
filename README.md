# 3Dpoints-plane_angle
Created a Python script to do the following:
1) Receive 3D coordinates in a cylindrical coordinate system
2) Fit a plane through these coordinate using least square method
3) Calculate angle between two plane created using step 1 & 2 by finding angle between normal vectors to the planes
4) Visualise these planes in a 3D space using Plotly
